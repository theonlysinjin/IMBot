# IMBot
An IRC -> IM Relay using the bitlbee IRC server


Wow, finding this in some random back up directory really took me back.
This was an awesome project that Brenton (Trixar_za) and I did quite a while back now...

The bitblee IRC server was the key, https://www.bitlbee.org/
They did the IM part, we relayed to IRC.


This bot, so to speak, connects as a server onto your IRC network.
It will relay the IM accounts you have set up, into said network.
The relayed users appear as actual users and have access to select commands, but they can join channels, etc.
